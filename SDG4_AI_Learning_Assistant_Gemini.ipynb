            "Welcome! As an intermediate Python programmer, you already grasp variables, data types, and basic functions. Now, we will focus on the fundamental control flow mechanisms—**Conditional Statements** and **Loops**—which allow your programs to make decisions and automate repetitive tasks efficiently.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Conditional Statements (Decision Making)\n",
            "\n",
            "Conditional statements allow a program to execute specific blocks of code only if certain conditions are met. In Python, this is primarily managed using the `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else` keywords.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Key Concepts:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Indentation is Crucial:** Python uses whitespace (indentation) to define the scope of the blocks associated with each conditional branch.\n",
            "*   **Boolean Expressions:** Conditions evaluate to either `True` or `False`. These often involve comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) or logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).\n",
            "\n",
            "**Structure Example:**\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "score = 85\n",
            "\n",
            "if score >= 90:\n",
            "    print(\"Grade A\")\n",
            "elif score >= 80:\n",
            "    # This block executes if the first condition (score >= 90) was False,\n",
            "    # and this new condition (score >= 80) is True.\n",
            "    print(\"Grade B\")\n",

            "\n",

            "#### A. The `for` Loop\n",
            "\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "#### B. The `while` Loop\n",
            "\n",
            "The `while` loop executes a block of code repeatedly *as long as* a specified condition remains `True`.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Crucial Consideration:** You must ensure that the condition eventually becomes `False`, or you will create an **infinite loop**.\n",

            "\n",
